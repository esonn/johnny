A simple simulator for the von Neumann CPU architecture, including a visual represetnation of memory, control unit, ALU and buses. Support for macro- and micro-instructions. Predefined but extensible instruction set.

Great thanks to the original authors:
 - Original implementation: Peter Dauscher
 - HTML5 implementation: David Laubersheimer

I only did minor adjustments.
