# johnny - A CPU simulator

A simple simulator for the von Neumann CPU architecture, including a visual representation of main memory, control unit, ALU and data- as well as address buses. Supports an in-built default instruction set of 10 (macro-)instructions, which are built on a series of microinstrutions - new macroinstructions can be created easily using a click-and-record feature.

Great thanks to the original authors:
 - Original implementation in Pascal: Peter Dauscher
 - HTML5 rewrite: David Laubersheimer

I only did minor adjustments, corrections, general clean-up and fixes.
